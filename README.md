This project is to test how clustering is showcased from a dataset, the 3D plots generated  represents the first 3 features as we do k-means clustering

The centroids are the center of each cluster it is calculated from the average of all datapoints within the cluster

Now because of we can see how some of them act differently there can be a couple of reasons,
the 3D plot is showing data according to the 3 features while the k means clustering according to all 5,
in K=4 for example we can see the orange one having variance of 5 while the other has variance of 8, the greater the variance the greater their spread is.
